# SimpleGreyscale
This is a simple greyscale shader for use with the Minecraft [Shader Mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1544257-).

This shader was created to assist in creating minecraft mods that are still usable by the colorblind.

## Limitations
The UI layer is still rendered with color.

## Usage
After installing Shader Mod, simply add the archive to your shaderpacks folder in your minecraft home directory.

See the documentation for Shader Mod for more details.

## Licence
This code is released to the public domain.
